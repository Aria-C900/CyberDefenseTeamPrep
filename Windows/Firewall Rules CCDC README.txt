This PowerShell script focuses on configuring Windows Firewall rules for different network profiles (Domain, Public, Private). It begins by enabling the firewall for all profiles and setting a default policy to block inbound and outbound traffic. Subsequently, the script removes existing rules and creates new rules for specified TCP and UDP ports, ICMP traffic, and an allowance for upstream DNS. This script helps enhance network security by selectively allowing traffic on specific ports and protocols while blocking the rest.
