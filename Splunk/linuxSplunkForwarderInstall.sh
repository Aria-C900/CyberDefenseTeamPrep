# Automates the installation of the Splunk Universal Forwarder. Currently set to v9.1.1, but that is easily changed.
# Works with Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Oracle Linux. You need to run this as sudo

# This was put together as an amalgamation of code from my own work, other automatic installation scripts, and AI to tie everything together.
# Lots time went into this script. Be nice to it plz <3
