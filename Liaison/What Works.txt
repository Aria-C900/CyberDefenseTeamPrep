Before running the scripts, run sudo dos2unix <name of file>, before using ./<name of file> in case script doesn't work. I think some of the formatting was altered when uploading into the github
Install dos2Unix using: sudo apt install dos2unix

FIM.sh / Works, run it as ./FIM.sh <file path for directory> and it will work. You can suspend it with Ctrl + C, or pkill FIM.sh (If you run it as ./FIM.sh <path to directory> &)

firewall_config.sh / Works, run it as sudo and follow the prompts it gives you.

firewall_config_dynamic.sh / TESTING, this new script should detect firewalld for CentOS 7 machines

TFTP_install.sh / Works, hit enter for all input fields, unless you want to change network configs. I changed the calling functions to remove the brackets at the end "()"

Honeypot.sh/ Works, user credentials are witin the file so check that before running it. Also, install Ansible before running the script.
If you try to run the script and something goes wrong, make sure to remove /opt/tpot directory, or else re-running the script will be difficult 

configure_ipv6.sh / Works, run it as sudo ./configure_ipv6.sh and when prompted, select which network adapter you wanna use and select ULA (u) to automatically select ipv6 prefix

IDS.sh / Works, run it as ./IDS.sh and follow the on-screen prompts. It will ask you for network adapter to use and IP address of machine in CIDR notation
